  abstract = {The concept of a reconciled tree arose independently in molecular
	systematics, parasitology, and biogeography as a means of describing
	historical associations. Examples of historical associations include
	genes and organisms, host and parasitic organisms, and organisms
	and areas. A reconciled tree combines the tree for a host and its
	associate into a single summary of the historical association between
	the two entities under the assumption that no horizontal transmission
	of associates has occurred. In this paper, I define reconciled trees,
	describe an algorithm for their computation, and develop measures
	to quantify the degree of fit between host and associate trees. Examples
	are given of applying the method to gene trees and species trees,
	host-parasite cospeciation, and biogeography. The problem of incorporating
	horizontal transmission of associates (e.g., dispersal or host switching)
	is also addressed by introducing the concept of maximizing the amount
	of codivergence (shared history) between the associates.},

  abstract = {Support for contradictory phylogenies is often obtained when molecular
	sequence data from different genes is used to reconstruct phylogenetic
	histories. Contradictory phylogenies can result from many data anomalies
	including unrecognized paralogy. Paralogy, defined as the reconstruction
	of a phylogenetic tree from a mixture of genes generated by duplications,
	has generally not been formally included in phylogenetic reconstructions.
	Here we undertake the task of reconstructing a single most likely
	evolutionary relationship among a range of taxa from a large set
	of apparently inconsistent gene trees. Under the assumption that
	differences among gene trees can be explained by gene duplications,
	and consequent losses, we have developed a method to obtain the global
	phylogeny minimizing the total number of postulated duplications
	and losses and to trace back such individual gene duplications to
	global genome duplications. We have used this method to infer the
	most likely phylogenetic relationship among 16 major higher eukaryotic
	taxa from the sequences of 53 different genes, Only five independent
	genome duplication events need to be postulated in order to explain
	the inconsistencies among these trees. (C) 1996 Academic Press, Inc.},
